# unrarr
Python script for extracting all .rar files in given directories. Designed to be run automatically, and to work with multipart rars.

You will need to edit the LOG_PATH and SEARCH_DIRS variables, as well as the set_output_dir function to work with your filesystem.

You will also need to install the rarfile module with `pip install rarfile`.
